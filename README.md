# Sorting Algorithm visualizer
I have used my limited knowledge of Pygame and made kind of a fun way to revice the basics of sorting techniques by making a visualisaiotn of few of them in Pygame.

# Sorting techniques used here
- Bubble
- quick
- selection

# Requiremets
- Pygame (pip install pygame)

# how to run
- select folder based on the sorting technique you wanna see
- run <b>show.py</b> inside the selected folder
